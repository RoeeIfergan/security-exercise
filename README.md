Exercise


Disclaimer:
This program was built in a ubuntu vm running on mac. Therefore was compiled on aarch64 and will not run on x86_64 computers.
To fix this issue i'd need to use the relevant X86_64 libraries but due to time restrictions and me not having a x86_64 device at reach to run a vm on to make a cross-compatable machine, this exec will only work on aarch64 machines :/
